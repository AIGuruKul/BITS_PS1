XPIA Simulation FastAPI Backend Server

This module implements a FastAPI backend server for educational Cross-Plugin Injection Attack (XPIA) 
simulations. The server provides endpoints for:

- Serving the main XPIA simulation website
- Managing AI agent status during simulations
- Handling data extraction reports from compromised agents
- Providing sensitive data endpoints for testing purposes
- Database operations for storing attack simulation results

The server is designed for educational cybersecurity training and demonstrates how XPIA attacks
can compromise AI agents to extract sensitive data from backend systems.

Security Warning: This is an educational simulation. Never deploy this in production environments.
